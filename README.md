## More about me: 

13 year old developer + mechatronics engineer, 5 years of experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, 4 years with Blender, 4 years with Unity, 3 years with Python, 3 years with Nodejs, 2 years with Fusion 360, 1.5 years with C++. I also know small amounts of many other languages (e.g. C#, GO, Java, etc). I'm looking to branch further into integrating software and hardware seamlessly, particularly with using AI to control hardware/robots.
